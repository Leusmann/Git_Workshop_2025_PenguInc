# Git_Workshop_2025_PenguInc

Welcome! This repository is used to share workshop materials and introduce participants to Git.

### About This Repository

This repository includes:
- Workshop preparation files (preparation.md & participants.md) to help you get started with Git and with using this repository.
- Our project "PinguInc", which serves as an example for practicing version control. Project files:
1. PinguInc.md – The main project document.
2. img/ – A folder containing images for the project.
3. team/ – A folder for team-member-related content.

We chose this project because it only requires minimal knowledge of Markdown, making it easy to follow along.

Getting Started:
- Follow the instructions in preparation.md to set up Git.
-> Add your name to participants.md as part of the setup verification.
- Explore the PinguInc project and practice working with Git during the workshop! 🐧
