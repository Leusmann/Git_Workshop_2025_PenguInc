# 🐧 PinguInc Website – Git DSC Workshop 2025

Welcome to the collaborative PinguInc markdown-based website project!

## 🧠 Scenario

Kowalski from PinguInc wants you to completely overhaul their digital presence. He's formed three task groups:

- 🧃 Marketing
- 💰 Finances
- 🛠️ Technique

But… he’s **picky** and won’t let you touch the original repository directly. Instead:

## ✅ Your Mission

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. Create a new **feature branch** named after your group:
   - `feature/marketing`
   - `feature/finances`
   - `feature/technique`
3. Do the following:
   - Add a new markdown file in `sections/` (your group intro).
   - Add **at least 5 new people** to the shared table in `data/team-members.md`.
4. When done, **open a pull request**. Make sure it can be merged without conflicts!
