# Git_Workshop_2025_PenguInc

Welcome! This repository is used to share workshop materials and introduce participants to Git.

### About This Repository

This repository includes:
- Workshop preparation files (preparation.md & participants.md) to help you get started with Git and with using this repository.
- Our project "PinguInc", which serves as an example for practicing version control. 🐧 Project files include:

  - PinguInc.md – The main project document.
  - img/ – A folder containing images for the project.
  - team/ – A folder for penguin-team-member-related content.

Working on our project requires only minimal knowledge of Markdown, making it easy to follow along.

### Before the workshop: Follow the instructions in preparation.md.
✅ Add your name to participants.md as part of the setup verification (last step of the workshop preparation).

❌ If you encounter issues you cannot fix on your own during the preparation and need assistance, we invite you to arrive at the workshop one hour early (9 AM), where we will do our best to help. To ensure we can plan accordingly, please send us an email in advance if you require support. While we will try to assist everyone, time may be limited.
